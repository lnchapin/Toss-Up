# Toss Up
Toss up is a recipe limiting site based on user inputs. It brings up the 3 highest rating recipes based on the parameters you put in. This was built using JavaScript, jQuery, Grid, Materialize, and the Food to Fork API.


Toss Up was just redesigned to fix errors found with [the WAVE tool](http://wave.webaim.org/)
The main issues I had with this page were low contrast and missing alt tags

Using the wave tool I increased the contrast in the textarea, the submit button, and links to recipes. One thing the wave tool didn't pick up on and I originally forgot to check was the way elements colors changed when being interacted with so I had to go back and fix those issues as well and now I know to check for that issue in the future.
